STORE PROJECT

Overview
This project showcases my development skills to potential employers. It imitates a real e-commerce website, https://www.emag.ro/, focusing on customer service and user experience. This is one of my first large projects as a developer, helping me understand how to optimize performance for both mobile and desktop devices. My project stands out in terms of performance and user interaction, emphasizing the importance of a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used
  -JavaScript
  -React.js
  -Vite for development server and build optimization

Performance Optimization Techniques
  -Code Splitting: Dividing code into smaller bundles to   
   improve load times.
  -Lazy Import: Loading components and non-critical data only 
   when needed.
  -React Suspense: Informing users when the page is loading 
   and background processes are running.
  -Lazy Loading Images: Using compressed images in WebP format 
   for faster load times.
  -Image Preloading: Preloading critical images for better 
   initial load performance.
  -DOM Size Reduction: Minimizing the number of displayed 
   products on the mobile version.
